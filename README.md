# ML
The AI module at UC Berkeley has nice resouces in Python including a version of Pacman for exploring reinforcement learning.
Homepage: http://ai.berkeley.edu/reinforcement.html
The Python resources can be downloaded from: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cs188websitecontent/projects/release/ reinforcement/v1/001/reinforcement.zip

The mLearningAgents.py file implements QLearningAgent for Pacman. 
- Replace this file in the reinforcement folder.
- Run the code by using the following command:

  python pacman.py -p QLearnAgent -x 2000 -n 2010 -l smallGrid
  
- -p QLearnAgent tells pacman.py code to let Pacman take controlled by an object that is an instance of a class QLearnAgent.
- -x 2000 will train the learner for 2000 episodes (you can use any number)
- -n 2010 will run it for 10 non-training episodes
- -l smallGrid runs the very reduced game
